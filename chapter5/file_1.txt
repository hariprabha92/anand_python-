unction calls
In the context of programming, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs
a computation. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of
statements. Later, you can “call” the function by name. We have already seen one example
of a function call:

The name of the function is t2♣❡ . The expression in parentheses is called the argument of
the function. The result, for this function, is the type of the argument.
It is common to say that a function “takes” an argument and “returns” a result. The result
is called the return value.
