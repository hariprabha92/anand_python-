Math functions
Python has a math module that provides most of the familiar mathematical functions. A
module is a file that contains a collection of related functions.
Before we can use the module, we have to import it:
This statement creates a module object named math. If you print the module object, you
get some information about it:
The module object contains the functions and variables defined in the module. To access
one of the functions, you have to specify the name of the module and the name of the
function, separated by a dot (also known as a period). This format is called dot notation.
